Creating a basic website using Github Pages is simple. It requires no knowledge of Git, and you can even type in the browser if you want.

- Create a new repo.
- Select Github pages.
- Create a file titled index.html in the docs/ directory.
- Open the file for editing.
- Paste this code in on the top line: `<!DOCTYPE html><script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mdme@0.3.0"></script><textarea>`
- Type the information you want below that line using Commonmark markdown.
- Commit.
- View your page at username.github.io/reponame.
